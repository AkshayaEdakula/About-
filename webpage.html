				<h2> The Golden Maknae of BTS </h2>
				<p> <b> "BTS member Jungkook" </b> was born in Busan, South Korea. He is 24 years old and is the youngest member of BTS. Jungkook attended the School of Performing Arts Seoul which caused him to start high school a year later than others because of his early debut in the music career. Jungkook joined BTS when he was only 15 years old, he is the main vocalist, sub-rapper and lead dancer of the group.

				Before BTS' debut Jungkook went to the US to do some dance training, he actually considered being a professional dancer but another member of the group (Jimin) convinced him to return to BTS. Jungkook is also into photography and video editing, he actually released a series of travel videos called the Golden Closet Films (GCF) which he filmed himself.

				Jungkook is nicknamed Golden Maknae which means "golden youngest” since his mother dreamed of gold before he was born. Jungkook really appreciates the BTS fandom, he has a tattoo saying ARMY (the BTS fandom name and also the members' initials) on his right knuckles, he also has a tattoo of the BTS ARMY logo on his hand and a crown on his finger meaning that his fans are kings. Before joining BTS he auditioned in a program called “Super Star K Season 3” in 2011,he never made in to the finals but got casting offers from seven agencies, including Big Hit Entertainment (the agency that got him and other to form BTS). Jungkook is the fourth member to join BTS.
